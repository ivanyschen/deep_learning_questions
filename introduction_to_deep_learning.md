A3. 
  - Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly. 
  - Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea. 
  - Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware). 
  
**Q4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, 
they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, 
without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?** 

A4. False

**Q5. Which plot represents relu?**  
  
A5. 
  
**Q6. Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, 
because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?**  
  
A6. False  
  
**Q7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data 
because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?**
  
A7. False  
  
**Q8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, 
say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)**

A8. 
  - It can be trained as a supervised learning problem. 
  - It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).  
  
**Q9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, 
what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?**  

![](/img/wk1_img2.png)
A9. x-axis is the amount of data. y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.

which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)**
  
A10.
  - Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
  - Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly. 
  
  
  
### Week 2: Neural Network Basics

**Q1. What does a neuron compute?**  
  
A1. A neuron computes a linear function (z = Wx + b) followed by an activation function
  
**Q2. Which of these is the "Logistic Loss"?**
  
A2. ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\large&space;L(y_\text{pred}^{(i)},&space;y_\text{true}^{(i)})&space;=&space;y_\text{true}^{(i)}&space;\log{y_\text{pred}^{(i)}}&space;&plus;&space;(1-y_\text{true}^{(i)})&space;\log(1&space;-&space;y_\text{pred}^{(i)}))
  
**Q3. Suppose img is a (32,32,3) array, representing a 32x32 image with 3 color channels red, green and blue. How do you reshape this into a column vector?**. 
  
A3. x = img.reshape((32*32*3,1))  
  
**Q4. Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b". What will be the shape of "c"?**
```
a = np.random.randn(2, 3) # a.shape = (2, 3)
b = np.random.randn(2, 1) # b.shape = (2, 1)
c = a + b
```
  
A4. c.shape = (2, 3)  
  
**Q5. Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b". What will be the shape of "c"?**
```
a = np.random.randn(4, 3) # a.shape = (4, 3)
b = np.random.randn(3, 2) # b.shape = (3, 2)
c = a*b
```
  
A5. The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!
  
**Q6. Suppose you have n input features per example. Recall that X = [x(1)x(2)...x(m)] What is the dimension of X? **
  
A6. (n, m)  
  
**Q7. Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b"**  
```
a = np.random.randn(12288, 150) # a.shape = (12288, 150)
b = np.random.randn(150, 45) # b.shape = (150, 45)
c = np.dot(a,b)
```
A7. (12288, 45)  
  
**Q8. How to vectorize the process?**  
```
# a.shape = (3,4)
# b.shape = (4,1)

for i in range(3):
  for j in range(4):
    c[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[j]
```
  
A8.
```
c = a + b.T
```

**Q9. Consider the following code. What will be c?**  
```
a = np.random.randn(3, 3)
b = np.random.randn(3, 1)
c = a * b
```
  
A9. This will invoke broadcasting, so b is copied three times to become (3,3), and \∗ is an element-wise product so c.shape will be (3, 3)  
  
Q10. Consider the following computation graph. What is the outpu J?  
  
![](/img/wk2_img1.png)
  
A10. J = (a - 1) * (b + c)

**Q2. The tanh activation usually works better than sigmoid activation function for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to zero, and so it centers the data better for the next layer. True/False?**

A2. True  
  
**Q3 Which of these is a correct vectorized implementation of forward propagation for layer l, where L1 ≤ l ≤ L?**  
  
A3. 
  - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;Z^{[l]}&space;=&space;W^{[l]}A^{[l-1]}&space;&plus;&space;b^{[l]}" title="Z^{[l]} = W^{[l]}A^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]}" />
  - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;A^{[l]}&space;=&space;g^{l}(Z^{l})" title="A^{[l]} = g^{l}(Z^{l})" />
  
**Q4. You are building a binary classifier for recognizing cucumbers (y=1) vs. watermelons (y=0). Which one of these activation functions would you recommend using for the output layer?**  

A4. Sigmoid  
  
**Q5. Consider the following code. What will be B.shape?**

```
  
A5. (A, 1)  
  
**Q6. Suppose you have built a neural network. You decide to initialize the weights and biases to be zero. Which of the following statements are True? (Check all that apply)**  
  
A6. Each neuron in the first hidden layer will perform the same computation. So even after multiple iterations of gradient descent each neuron in the layer will be computing the same thing as other neurons. 

**Q7. Logistic regression’s weights w should be initialized randomly rather than to all zeros, because if you initialize to all zeros, then logistic regression will fail to learn a useful decision boundary because it will fail to “break symmetry”, True/False?**

A7. False  
  
**Q8. You have built a network using the tanh activation for all the hidden units. You initialize the weights to relative large values, using np.random.randn()\*1000. What will happen?**  
  
A8. This will cause the inputs of the tanh to also be very large, thus causing gradients to be close to zero. The optimization algorithm will thus become slow. 
  
**Q9. Consider the following 1 hidden layer neural network. Which of the following statements are True? (Check all that apply).**  
![](/img/wk2_img2.png)

  - \[ ] The earlier layers of a neural network are typically computing more complex features of the input than the deeper layers. 
  
**Q4. Vectorization allows you to compute forward propagation in an L-layer neural network without an explicit for-loop (or any other explicit iterative loop) over the layers l=1, 2, …,L. True/False?**

A4. False (Vectorization helps reduce the for loops for passing each training instances.)
  
**Q5. Assume we store the values for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;n^{[l]}" title="n^{[l]}" /> in an array called layers, as follows: layer_dims = [nx,4,3,2,1]. So layer 1 has four hidden units, layer 2 has 3 hidden units and so on. Which of the following for-loops will allow you to initialize the parameters for the model?**

A5.
```
for(i in range(1, len(layer_dims))):
  parameter[‘W’ + str(i)] = np.random.randn(layers[i], layers[i-1])) * 0.01
  parameter[‘b’ + str(i)] = np.random.randn(layers[i], 1) * 0.01
```

**Q7. During forward propagation, in the forward function for a layer lll you need to know what is the activation function in a layer (Sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.). During backpropagation, the corresponding backward function also needs to know what is the activation function for layer lll, since the gradient depends on it. True/False?**

A7. True  
  
**Q8. There are certain functions with the following properties: (i) To compute the function using a shallow network circuit, you will need a large network (where we measure size by the number of logic gates in the network), but (ii) To compute it using a deep network circuit, you need only an exponentially smaller network. True/False?**
  
A8. True
