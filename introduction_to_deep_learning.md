### Week 1

**Q1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?**  
  
A1. Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries. 
  
**Q2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)**
  
A2. 
  - Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition. 
  - We have access to a lot more data.
  - We have access to a lot more computational power. 
  
**Q3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)**

A3. 
  - Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly. 
  - Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea. 
  - Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware). 
  
**Q4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, 
they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, 
without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?** 

A4. False

**Q5. Which plot represents relu?**  
  
A5. 
  
**Q6. Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, 
because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?**  
  
A6. False  
  
**Q7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data 
because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?**
  
A7. False  
  
**Q8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, 
say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)**

A8. 
  - It can be trained as a supervised learning problem. 
  - It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).  
  
**Q9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, 
what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?**  
  
A9. x-axis is the amount of data. y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.  

**Q10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), 
which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)**
  
A10.
  - Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
  - Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
