### Week 1 Recureent Neural Networks

**Q1. Suppose your training examples are sentences (sequences of words). 
Which of the following refers to the jthj^{th}jth word in the ithi^{th}ith training example?**

A2. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;T_x&space;=&space;T_y" title="T_x = T_y" />

**Q3. To which of these tasks would you apply a many-to-one RNN architecture? (Check all that apply).**

A3. 
- \[ ] Speech recognition (input an audio clip and output a transcript) 
- \[x] Sentiment classification (input a piece of text and output a 0/1 to denote positive or negative sentiment)
- \[ ] Image classification (input an image and output a label)
- \[x] Gender recognition from speech (input an audio clip and output a label indicating the speakerâ€™s gender)
